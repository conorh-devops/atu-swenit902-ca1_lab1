# atu-swenit902-ca1_lab1
The first lab for continuous assessment in SWEN_IT902

## Name application
The application will request user input for a name which it will then return to the user before exiting.

## How to build and run application
The console application is built targetting .Net 6 runtime and will require this on local machine to run. 

The runtime can be found here https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download.

If you intend to build or develop the application further you will require the .Net 6 SDK which is available at the same URL. 

.Net 6 will run on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
